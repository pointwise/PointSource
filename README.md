A Glyph script for inserting a 2D or 3D point source into a grid.

## Generating Geometry
This script inserts a point source into an existing grid block or domain.

The script detects the grid's CAE dimensionality and prompts for input
accordingly.

In 2D, the point source is built as a collection of unclosed, concentric,
circular connectors centered around a user-defined location. An additional,
two-point connector is created to capture the center point. These connectors are
inserted into a user-selected domain as interior edges.

In 3D, the point source is built as a collection of unclosed, concentric,
spherical domains centered around a user-defined location. An additional,
half-disk domain is created to capture the unused seam points. These domains are
inserted into a user-selected block as interior baffles.

For both 2D and 3D, the point source layer spacing is controlled using a
connector's distribution. One point source layer will be create for each
connector point *except* for the first. The connector must exist before running
the script.

### Limitations
* The script does *not* check if a point source pierces a boundary of the targeted block or domain.
* 2D point sources are built in an XY plane.

## Running The Script

* Build or open the grid into which you want to insert a point source.
* Execute this script.
* Select the Block/Domain target into which you want to insert the point source.
  However, if the grid only contains a single target, it will be used
  automatically.
* Select point source location. You can select any existing grid point (it is
  often simpler to select the starting point of the connector selected in the
  next step).
* Select the connector to use for the point source layer spacing.
* Wait for the script to finish.


## Sourcing This Script

It is possible to source this script in your own Glyph scripts and use it as a library.

To source this script add the following lines to your script:

    set disableAutoRun_PtSrc 1 ;# disable the autorun
    source "/some/path/to/your/copy/of/pointsource.glf"]

See the scripts `test/test2D.glf` and `test/test3D.glf` for examples.
